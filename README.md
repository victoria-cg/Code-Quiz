# Code-Quiz

## Description

This site was created as a code quiz challenge for the UT EdX Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of the assignment is to use web APIs, client side storage, and the DOM to make a dynamic quiz that displays a timer, stores scores, and displays several multiple choice questions for the user that they can answer. It is currently unfinished, and the user can see that when starting the quiz, at this stage only the timer will display. More edits in the future will add all the desired functionality.

## Installation
